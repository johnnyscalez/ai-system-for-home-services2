- **Ad Network**: Beehiiv's native ad network matches sponsors to your newsletter automatically. You approve/reject each ad. Revenue depends on list size, niche, and engagement. Requires Scale plan.
- **Boosts**: Earn $1-$3 per subscriber from other newsletters promoting yours (and vice versa). Like Kit's paid recommendations but beehiiv-native. Requires Scale plan.
- **Referral program**: Built-in milestone-based system (like Morning Brew's). Subscribers share a referral link, earn rewards at milestone tiers. Requires Scale plan.

- **Pricing advantage**: 0% platform fee (vs Substack's 10%, Kit's 0.6%). At scale, this saves thousands.
- **Setup**: Settings > Payments > Connect Stripe > Configure premium tiers > Toggle paywall in posts

## In Ghost
- **Paid memberships**: Built-in Stripe integration, tiered access (free/paid/premium), 0% Ghost fee
- **Pricing**: Self-hosted = free (+ hosting + Mailgun costs), Ghost(Pro) from $15/mo but paid subs require Publisher plan ($29/mo)

- **Limitations**: Mailgun-only for self-hosted email, no digest newsletters (one email per post), Starter plan can't accept payments

## In Paved
- **Marketplace**: List your newsletter for curated sponsor bookings — Paved handles invoices, contracts, and payouts. Requires 5,000+ subscribers and ESP integration for verified badge.
- **Ad Network**: Insert a code snippet in your ESP template for automated CPC-based ads (~$1.45 avg per click). Lower effort, lower CPM than direct Marketplace placements.
- **Booker**: Manage your own direct sponsor relationships through Paved — they handle billing and insertion orders while you keep control of sponsor selection.
- **Radar**: Lead enrichment to identify potential sponsors and do outbound sponsor outreach with data-backed targeting.
- **Pricing**: 30% commission on Marketplace sponsorships. CPM typically $15-$100 depending on niche (B2B/finance at top, general interest at bottom).
- **ESP integrations**: ActiveCampaign, AWeber, Beehiiv, Brevo, Campaign Monitor, Constant Contact, ConvertKit, EmailOctopus, GetResponse, Mailchimp, MailJet, MailerLite, Zoho.
- **Best strategy**: Use both Marketplace (premium placements, 1-2 per issue) and Ad Network (fill remaining inventory) to maximize revenue.

## In Buttondown

- **Limitations**: No discovery network (unlike Substack or Beehiiv Boosts), no built-in referral program, most features are paid add-ons ($9-$79/mo each), smaller ecosystem.
- **Best for**: Developers, privacy-conscious creators, writers who want Markdown, anyone who wants minimal fees on paid subscriptions.

## In MailerLite
- **Paid newsletter subscriptions**: Built-in Stripe integration for recurring payments. Gate content to paid subscribers vs free. Manage subscriber tiers directly in MailerLite.
- **Pricing**: No MailerLite transaction fee (just Stripe ~2.9% + $0.30). 1 paid subscription product on Free, 3 on Growing Business ($10/mo), unlimited on Advanced ($20/mo).
- **Sponsorships**: Use content blocks and templates for consistent sponsor placement. MailerLite is listed as a supported ESP on Paved (Ad Network + Marketplace).
- **Strengths**: Cheapest option for paid newsletters — no platform fee on subscriptions, just Stripe. Landing pages included for subscriber growth. Simple automation for welcome/onboarding.
- **Limitations**: No built-in referral system (use SparkLoop). No discovery network (unlike Substack or Beehiiv). Basic automation compared to Kit or Beehiiv. No built-in ad network or boost marketplace.

- **Best for**: Newsletter operators on any supported ESP who want to monetize via recommendations and/or grow via referral programs. Strongest option for cross-ESP recommendation networks.

## In Mailchimp
- **No native paid newsletter**: Use Stripe + Zapier to manage paid subscribers via tags/groups
- **Sponsorships**: Use content blocks and templates for consistent sponsor placement
- **Strengths**: Strong email design tools, good for ad-supported newsletters
- **Limitations**: Not built for paid subscriptions — requires workarounds

## In Megahit
- **Subscriber enrichment**: Enriches newsletter subscriber emails with LinkedIn data — job titles, employers, LinkedIn profiles. Identifies sponsorship decision-makers already in your audience.
- **Inside-out sponsor discovery**: Unlike SponsorGap or Who Sponsors Stuff (which search external databases), Megahit finds potential sponsors *within* your existing subscriber list. Warm leads with higher reply rates.
- **Auto-enrichment**: New subscribers are automatically enriched upon signup after initial configuration.
- **ESP integrations**: Beehiiv, Kit, Campaign Monitor, EmailOctopus, Ghost, HubSpot, Mailchimp, SendGrid, Substack.
- **Privacy**: Runs on customer-controlled servers — Megahit never stores or accesses your email list.
- **Pricing**: $600 one-time fee. No subscription, no free plan, no trial. Book a demo first.
- **Limitations**: No API, no webhooks, no Zapier/Make. UI-only. Gmail-heavy lists will have lower match rates than work-email lists. Solo founder product.
- **Best for**: B2B newsletter publishers with 5,000+ subscribers who want to monetize by finding warm sponsor leads in their own audience before doing cold outreach.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-megahit` for enrichment workflows, ESP setup, and comparison with sponsor intelligence tools.

## In BuySellAds
- **Ad network**: Contextual advertising marketplace connecting advertisers with publishers across websites, newsletters, and podcasts. 200+ publishers in the network.
- **Sub-networks**: Carbon Ads (developers/designers), Coin.Network (crypto) — niche-specific inventory with pre-qualified advertisers.

- **Publisher commission**: 25% BSA take rate (publisher keeps 75%). Self-serve shopping cart reduces to 15% take rate (publisher keeps 85%).
- **Ad formats**: Display, native, sponsored content, email ads, podcast ads.
- **Managed sales model**: BSA team handles advertiser relationships — three tiers: Premier Partner (end-to-end), Add-On Sales (complement your team), Supplemental Sales (fill unsold inventory).
- **Zapier triggers**: Deal sent, deal won, spot sold — automate notifications to Slack, CRM, etc.
- **Strengths**: Human-curated placements (not purely programmatic), dedicated account management, contextual targeting (content-based not cookie-based), trusted by Shopify/AWS/Slack/MongoDB.
- **Limitations**: No guaranteed fill rate, 25% commission is higher than some alternatives, API key requires contacting account manager, advertiser pricing not transparent.
- **Best for**: Developer/design/crypto publishers with established traffic who want managed ad sales and premium brand partnerships. Not ideal for small newsletters (<10K subscribers) due to low fill rates.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-buysellads` for API integration, troubleshooting, and platform-specific help.

## In adly.news
- **Two-sided marketplace**: Newsletter advertising marketplace at adly.news connecting publishers with advertisers. Dual discovery — publishers list ad slots, advertisers create campaigns describing their ideal audience.
- **Verified metrics**: Subscriber count, open rate, and CTR are pulled automatically from ESPs (Beehiiv, Kit) and verified. Sponsors see the same data publishers see.
- **Bidding & negotiation**: Advertisers can book at listed prices or make offers. Publishers can accept, reject, or counter. Built-in in-app messaging for coordination.
- **Campaign feature**: Advertisers create campaigns describing target audience and budget. Newsletters browse and apply. Useful for brands that don't know which newsletters exist.
- **Pricing**: Free to join both sides. Commission on transactions (% not publicly disclosed). Ad prices start at ~$50 for smaller newsletters. No minimum budget for advertisers.
- **Payments**: Stripe-powered. Funds held until the ad runs. Automated payouts to publishers.

## In Admailr

- **Best for**: Publishers who want hands-off automated ad revenue without managing sponsor relationships. Complements direct sponsorship tools (Paved, Hecto, Sponsy) for unsold inventory.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-admailr` for API integration, ESP setup, troubleshooting, and optimization.

## In Social Presence
- **AI-powered marketplace**: Newsletter advertising marketplace at socialpresence.io connecting advertisers with publishers through AI-powered discovery. 5,000+ publishers claimed, 300M+ subscribers.

- **Platform skill**: `/sales-socialpresence` for storefront setup, campaign management, and platform-specific help.

## In Passendo
- **Email ad server + SSP**: Passendo is a full-stack email ad server with a built-in programmatic exchange (SSP). Purpose-built for email since 2016, serving 250M+ monthly ad impressions across 150+ premium international publishers.
- **Priority waterfall**: Automated ad decisioning — guaranteed direct-sold deals fill first, then programmatic exchange demand (15+ partners), then house ads. Maximizes revenue by prioritizing highest-value commitments.
- **Direct-sold campaigns**: Full campaign management — A/B testing, CPM/CPC/CPA models, sponsorship deals with SOV delivery, inclusion/exclusion filters.
- **First-party data targeting**: Cookie-free targeting based on email address and subscriber data. GDPR-compliant.
- **CNAME integration**: All ESP integrations use CNAME DNS records — ad images load from your domain, preserving deliverability.
- **Pricing**: Volume-based CPM tiers with minimum monthly commitment plus one-time onboarding fee. No published prices — custom quotes only.
- **Onboarding**: Not self-serve — Passendo provides dedicated human onboarding (2-4 weeks average). They handle tag setup, CNAME config, and demand partner connections.
- **Limitations**: No Zapier/Make/MCP. API exists but docs not publicly accessible. Image-only creatives (no HTML/CSS customization). Image size upload limits reported.
- **Best for**: Mid-to-large publishers (100K+ monthly opens) wanting managed programmatic email ad serving with premium exchange demand. Too heavy for small newsletters — use Admailr (no minimum) or Paved Ad Network instead.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-passendo` for ad server setup, fill rate optimization, ESP integration, and platform-specific help.

## In Kevel
- **API-first ad server**: Kevel (formerly Adzerk) is ad server infrastructure — you build your own custom ad platform using their APIs. Server-to-server architecture, not a plug-and-play ad network. Powers Home Depot, PayPal, Lyft. 3B+ daily API requests.
- **Email ad serving**: Serves image-only creatives in newsletters via static HTML tags. No JS/iFrame support in email. Campaign → Flight → Creative hierarchy.
- **Gmail workarounds required**: Gmail caches identical image URLs across recipients (breaks impression counting) and proxies image requests through their own IPs (breaks geo-targeting). Fix: append unique per-subscriber segment to image URL + `?key={userKey}` parameter.
- **Revenue model**: You control pricing — CPM, CPC, CPA, or flat rate. Kevel provides the ad decisioning engine; you set the business terms.
- **Targeting**: Geo, keyword, custom properties, user-level (via UserDB), audience segments (via Kevel Audience). Frequency capping and ad pacing at flight level.
- **Pricing**: Custom only — no published tiers. Based on features + monthly request volume. Free trial available.
- **Integrations**: No native Zapier/Make. SDKs for JavaScript and Ruby. OpenAPI spec available. Full REST API.
- **Best for**: Engineering teams building custom ad platforms for marketplaces, publisher networks, or apps. Overkill for simple newsletter ad monetization — use Admailr or Paved instead.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-kevel` for API integration, email ad setup, campaign management, and troubleshooting.

## In PostApex
- **CPC ad network**: PostApex is an email newsletter ad network connecting advertisers with 500+ publishers across 50+ categories, reaching 100M+ subscribers. London-based, founded 2022.
- **Ad formats**: Native ads (blend with newsletter content), Affiliate ads (beta — action-based payouts), Programmatic ads (coming soon — not yet available).
- **Revenue model**: CPC-only — publishers earn per click, not per impression. Advertisers set their own CPC bid. PostApex takes a $0.05–$0.30 spread per dollar.
- **Earnings example**: 10K subscribers × 5% CTR × $1.50 avg CPC = $750 per campaign. Smaller newsletters earn proportionally less.
- **Publisher workflow**: Manual — browse approved ads in dashboard, copy tracking links, style into your ESP template. No automated ad insertion.
- **Pricing**: Free for both publishers and advertisers. No platform fees, no signup costs, no withdrawal charges.
- **Payment**: Earnings accumulate in wallet. ~$100 minimum payout threshold (user-reported). Payment schedule and methods not publicly documented.
- **Limitations**: No API, no webhooks, no Zapier/Make/MCP. Completely UI-only. Click underreporting has been reported by users. Support responsiveness varies.
- **Best for**: Small publishers wanting zero-cost entry into newsletter ad revenue with no subscriber minimum. Good for backfill alongside premium sponsors. Not ideal if you need automated ad insertion (use Admailr) or direct sponsor relationships (use Paved/Hecto).
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-postapex` for publisher setup, revenue optimization, troubleshooting, and ad network comparison.

## In AdButler
- **Full-stack ad server**: AdButler is a managed ad server (25+ years, 1,000+ clients) with display, video, mobile, native, and email ad serving, plus a self-serve advertiser portal and programmatic SSP. Independent alternative to Google Ad Manager.
- **Email ad serving**: Create email-type zones, upload image-only creatives, generate zone tags with your ESP's EUID macro, paste into template. Ads can be updated after send (images resolve dynamically from CDN).
- **Self-serve portal**: Let advertisers create, manage, and pay for their own campaigns through a white-labeled portal. Approval workflows, payment processing included.
- **Revenue model**: You set your own pricing — CPM, CPC, flat rate. Direct deals + programmatic auctions + self-serve in one platform.
- **API & MCP**: REST API at `api.adbutler.com/v2/` (Bearer token auth). JSON ad serving API at `servedbyadbutler.com/adserve` (no auth). MCP server for Claude/Cursor (`@adbutler/mcp-server`). PHP and Node.js SDKs.
- **Pricing**: Essentials $179/mo (1M requests, 10 zones), Standard $682/mo (10M requests, 100 zones). API Access and Targeting are paid add-ons. Free trial available.
- **Infrastructure**: 99.99% uptime SLA, sub-100ms response, 300+ global edge locations.
- **Limitations**: API Access is a paid add-on on all base plans. Email zones are image-only. Essentials caps at 10 zones and 10 advertisers. No Zapier/Make. No webhooks documented. UI feels dated (G2 reviewer feedback).
- **Best for**: Mid-to-large publishers wanting a managed ad server with self-serve portal and email ad support without building from scratch. Too expensive for small newsletters — use Admailr (no minimum, free) or PostApex (free CPC network) instead.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-adbutler` for ad server setup, API integration, MCP server, email ad serving, and troubleshooting.

## In Epom
- **Hosted ad server + white-label DSP**: Epom is a hosted ad server and white-label DSP founded in 2010, serving 350+ clients across 40+ countries. Manages direct and programmatic ad inventory across web, mobile, in-app, and CTV channels.
- **Email ad serving**: Create email-type zones with image-only creatives. Generate ad tags and paste into your ESP template. Ads resolve dynamically from Epom's CDN.
- **Key differentiator**: API access, RTB module, white-labeling, and support are included on all plans — competitors (AdButler, Kevel) charge extra for some of these.
- **Revenue model**: You set pricing — CPC, CPM, CPA. Direct-sold campaigns plus RTB module (free for publishers) for programmatic backfill.
- **API**: REST API included on all plans (HMAC auth). 60+ endpoints for campaigns, advertisers, targeting, analytics, banners, zones. No webhooks or Zapier/Make.
- **Analytics**: 40+ real-time and historical metrics with multidimensional custom reporting. Export to CSV, XLS, PDF, HTML, JSON.
- **Pricing**: Ad server from $250/mo (~$224/mo per 10M impressions). DSP Light $250/mo or 5% spend. 14-day free trial (30M monthly impressions).
- **Limitations**: No self-serve advertiser portal (unlike AdButler). No MCP server. No webhooks. UI is complex for newcomers (800+ features). White-labeling requires premium package.
- **Best for**: Mid-market publishers and ad networks wanting a customizable ad server with API and RTB included in the base price. For self-serve portal, use AdButler. For API-first custom builds, use Kevel. For automated email ads without setup, use Admailr.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-epom` for ad server setup, API integration, DSP configuration, and troubleshooting.

## In Broadstreet
- **Direct-sold ad manager**: Broadstreet is an ad manager built for local news, regional magazines, and B2B publishers who sell ads directly to advertisers. #1 rated on G2 for local/B2B publisher ad servers. No programmatic/RTB — purely direct-sold.
- **Newsletter ad zones**: Create zones in the Broadstreet dashboard, get static zone code, paste into your ESP template. Supports MailChimp, ActiveCampaign, ConstantContact, HubSpot. Static code method preferred over RSS merge.
- **Gmail cachebusting**: Append ESP-specific merge tags to zone URLs to prevent Gmail from caching the same image for all subscribers. For MailChimp: `?*|CAMPAIGN_UID|**|UNIQID|*`.
- **Position numbering**: When using the same zone multiple times, increment the position: `/click/0`, `/click/1`, `/click/2`. Without this, ads may duplicate.
- **Keyword targeting**: Add `kw=tech,software&skw=true` to zone URLs for content-based ad matching. `skw=true` enables soft matching (non-tagged ads also eligible).
- **Overflow handling**: Add `overflow=0` to show a blank pixel instead of duplicating when a zone has no ad assigned.
- **Sponsored content tracking**: Native click tracking with timestamp and location data on WordPress posts. Broadstreet tracks independently of Google Analytics — advertisers don't need GA access.
- **Automated PDF reports**: Client-ready reports combining web, newsletter, and sponsored content data. Scheduled delivery by email.
- **Pricing**: Manual $299/mo (1-2 users), Automatic $399/mo, Enterprise custom, Premier $2,999/mo. No free plan or trial. Valet service $10 per 15 minutes.
- **Limitations**: No programmatic/RTB (direct-sold only). Newsletter ads are image-only (no JS/dynamic formats). Campaign de-duplication doesn't work in email (requires JS). No Zapier/Make. No webhooks. API docs are JS-rendered.
- **Best for**: Local news, regional magazine, and B2B publishers with direct sales teams who want purpose-built ad management with newsletter integration and automated reporting. For programmatic, use Epom or AdButler. For self-serve advertiser portal, use AdButler.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-broadstreet` for ad server setup, newsletter zone integration, API usage, WordPress plugin, and troubleshooting.

## In AdPlugg
- **Budget ad server + ad manager**: AdPlugg is a cloud-based ad server with plugins for WordPress, Ghost, Drupal, Joomla, Squarespace, Wix, Weebly, and Blogger. Targets bloggers and small publishers who want simple ad management at low cost.

- **Limitations**: No API, no webhooks, no Zapier/Make. All management is through the web dashboard. No programmatic/RTB. No self-serve advertiser portal. No sponsored content tracking. Flash ads listed but deprecated.
- **Best for**: Bloggers and small publishers wanting the cheapest way to manage their own display and email ads. Too basic for mid-large publishers — use AdButler (self-serve portal, API) or Broadstreet (direct-sold, reports) instead.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-adplugg` for WordPress/Ghost setup, email ad configuration, and troubleshooting.

## In AdSpeed
- **Affordable hosted ad server**: AdSpeed is a hosted ad server established in 2000, serving publishers, advertisers, agencies, and ad networks. Starts at $9.95/mo for 100K impressions with sliding scale pricing. All plans include email newsletter zones and REST API access.
- **Email newsletter ads**: Create an Email/Newsletter zone type. Only image banner ads are supported — no HTML, no rich media. Ad tag is a static `<a>` + `<img>` pair (no JavaScript). Paste into any ESP HTML template.
- **Unique pair matching**: If your ESP supports merge tags (e.g., MailChimp `*|EMAIL_UID|*`), add `&pair=em@{MERGE_TAG}` to both the click URL and image URL. This enables multiple active ads in one zone with per-recipient impression-to-click tracking.
- **Without merge tags**: Keep only one active ad per zone at a time. Switch ads via deactivation or start/end date scheduling.
- **Keyword targeting**: Add `&keywords=brandname` to serve specific ads based on subscriber segment.

- **Affiliate program**: $50 flat per referral (90-day retention required).
- **Best for**: Budget-conscious publishers who want hosted ad serving with email newsletter support and API access without managing their own server. For self-hosted free, use Revive. For self-serve advertiser portal, use AdButler. For direct-sold local, use Broadstreet.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-adspeed` for ad server setup, email zone configuration, API usage, and troubleshooting.

- **Image-only creatives**: Email ads must use JPEG, GIF, or PNG images. Code-based images and HTML5 creatives are not accepted for email zones.

## In Lettergrowth
- **Cross-promotion directory**: Free directory of 1,300+ newsletters open to cross-promotion partnerships. Search by category, subscriber count, or recency at app.lettergrowth.com.
- **How it connects to monetization**: Cross-promotion grows your subscriber base, which directly increases sponsorship CPM value and paid subscription revenue potential. Use Lettergrowth to find swap partners, then monetize the larger audience via sponsorships (`/sales-paved`, `/sales-hecto`) or paid subscriptions.
- **No direct monetization**: Lettergrowth itself doesn't generate revenue — it's a partner discovery tool. The monetization happens through the audience you build.
- **Best for**: Newsletter operators under 10K subscribers who want free audience growth through mutual swaps before investing in paid recommendation networks.
- **Limitations**: No API, no automation, no built-in tracking. All outreach and arrangement is manual.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-lettergrowth` for profile setup, partner evaluation, outreach templates, and cross-promotion strategy.

## In Collab Match
- **Niche cross-promotion directory**: ~200 newsletters at collabmatch.io, concentrated in Business, Tech, Health, and Web3. Public per-newsletter pages at `collabmatch.io/newsletter/{slug}` (e.g., `/podup`).
- **How it connects to monetization**: Cross-promotion grows your subscriber base, which raises sponsorship CPM value and paid-subscription revenue potential. Use Collab Match for niche-specific Web3/tech swap partners, then monetize the expanded audience via sponsorships (`/sales-paved`, `/sales-hecto`) or paid subs.
- **Weekly matching**: Platform proposes partner matches on a weekly cadence based on size and niche — manual coordination by both parties.
- **No direct monetization**: Like Lettergrowth, Collab Match itself doesn't generate revenue — it's a partner discovery tool. Monetization happens through the larger audience.
- **No API, no webhooks, no Zapier/Make**: All outreach is manual. UTM-tag swap links for attribution.
- **Small indie project**: Site has shown intermittent availability; verify the founder is actively maintaining it before investing time in profile setup. Confusable products `collab.match.app` and `collabmatch.app` are NOT the same.
- **Best for**: Web3, crypto, and tech newsletter operators under 5K subscribers wanting niche-specific swap partners; useful layered on top of Lettergrowth for broader coverage.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-collabmatch` for profile setup, niche fit evaluation, public directory outreach, and comparison with Lettergrowth/SparkLoop/Beehiiv Boosts.

- **Tools directory**: 100+ newsletter tools catalogued with reviews and "alternatives" comparisons — treat as curated content surface, not unbiased reviews.
- **No API, no webhooks, no Zapier/Make/MCP**: Confirmed against changelog. CSV exports (Basic+) are the only data-out path.
- **Best for**: Solo publishers 1K-50K subs wanting discovery + sponsor pitching + Media Kits in one dashboard. Also useful for advertisers researching newsletters to sponsor.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-inboxreads` for plan selection, Opportunities Board tuning, Media Kit setup, CSV-export CRM patterns, and comparison with Lettergrowth/Paved/Sponsy/Reletter.

## In MutualGro
- **Creator collaboration platform**: UK-based, AI-powered partner matching (paid tier), scheduled X/LinkedIn posting (paid tier), accepts non-newsletter projects (indie SaaS, courses, podcasts) alongside newsletters.

- **Limitations**: No API, no webhooks, no Zapier/Make/MCP. Self-reported audience metrics — verify partners' real numbers before major swaps. UK-based indie team; smaller partner pool than InboxReads (5,600+) or Lettergrowth (1,300+).
- **Best for**: Multi-project creators, indie SaaS founders, and newsletter operators wanting matching + posting bundled in one cheap subscription.
- **Platform skill**: `/sales-mutualgro` for plan selection, profile setup, AI matching tuning, scheduled posting setup, and comparison with Lettergrowth/Collab Match/InboxReads/SparkLoop.
