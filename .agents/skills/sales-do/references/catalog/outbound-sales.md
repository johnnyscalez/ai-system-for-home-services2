# Outbound Sales & Sequences


## /sales-agency-outbound

Multi-client outbound for lead gen agencies — infrastructure architecture, client isolation, domain strategy, warmup at scale, white-labeling, unified reporting, client onboarding playbooks, and cross-client operations. Use when one client's domain reputation is dragging down others, new client onboarding takes too long, mailbox warmup isn't scaling across clients, can't isolate sending infrastructure per client, or need a repeatable playbook for agency-wide reporting. Do NOT use for Smartlead-specific platform config (use /sales-smartlead), single-domain deliverability (use /sales-deliverability), or individual campaign strategy (use /sales-cadence).


## /sales-field-sales

Hyperlocal field-sales strategy — door-to-door / territory / route-based outbound to cash-heavy local SMB owners (restaurants, gas stations, convenience stores, salons, gyms, contractors, HVAC, lawn care) who ignore email cadences and aren't on Apollo or ZoomInfo. Covers corridor and territory target-list building from local sources (Google Maps Places API, Yelp Fusion, Foursquare, Outscraper — NOT Apollo), route planning and density optimization, 60-second in-person pitch frameworks, objection handling for cash-heavy owners, non-email follow-up via SMS / handwritten note / phone, and platform selection across SalesRabbit, Spotio, Map My Customers, Badger Maps, Outfield, Repsly, Skynamo, Geopointe. Use when planning a single-corridor pilot before multi-city expansion, can't find local SMBs in Apollo, an email cadence isn't getting replies from restaurant or gas-station owners, deciding which field-sales platform to pick for a small rep team, or following up on an in-person "maybe" without an email sequence. Do NOT use for database-driven B2B SaaS prospect lists (use /sales-prospect-list), digital email/LinkedIn cadences (use /sales-cadence), or post-call coaching on a recorded in-person visit (use /sales-siro).


## /sales-two-sided-marketplace

Two-sided marketplace GTM strategy — the cold-start chicken-and-egg problem, supply-vs-demand sequencing, flywheel mechanics, supply-side recruiting in tight local labor markets, and a single-corridor pilot framework before multi-city expansion for on-demand and recurring service marketplaces (cleaning, food delivery, courier, lawn care, mobile detailing, home services, pet care). Use when stuck on the chicken-and-egg problem and unsure whether to seed supply first or demand first, can't recruit 1099 gig workers fast enough to fulfill the demand you're closing, every demand-side sales call should double as a supply recruiting call but you don't know how to flip the "I don't mind cleaning the bathrooms" objection into a recruit, evaluating Wonolo / Instawork / Bluecrew / Workstream / Craigslist / Indeed as supply-side channels, planning a single-corridor pilot before multi-corridor or multi-city expansion, or writing a one-page integrated GTM plan tying brand + demand + supply + local visibility together. Do NOT use for the demand-side execution layer — door-to-door / territory / 60-second pitch design — (use /sales-field-sales) or the supply-side payment infrastructure (use /sales-marketplace-payouts).


## /sales-marketplace-payouts

Marketplace payouts strategy — selecting and operating the payment infrastructure that pays 1099 supply workers, sellers, drivers, hosts, and creators on a two-sided marketplace. Covers Stripe Connect (Standard / Express / Custom), PayPal Hyperwallet, Adyen for Platforms, Trolley, Tipalti, Routable, dots.dev, Branch, Nium, Wise Business, and Tremendous — when to pick each, the connected-account vs custodial trade-off, KYC and onboarding burden, daily-vs-weekly-vs-on-demand pay schedules, multi-currency, tax form generation (1099-K, 1099-NEC, W-9, W-8), and the 1099-misclassification risk that worker payment design carries. Use when deciding between Stripe Connect Standard vs Express vs Custom for a 1099 cleaning marketplace, comparing Hyperwallet vs Trolley for multi-country payouts, the supply side is churning because payouts arrive too slowly, can't decide whether to use a per-payout API (Trolley, Routable) or a full marketplace stack (Stripe Connect, Adyen for Platforms), need on-demand pay to compete on supply recruiting (Branch), worker classification risk shows up in how you set the payout schedule, or planning the 1099-K / 1099-NEC tax form workflow. Do NOT use for buyer-side checkout optimization or payment collection (use /sales-checkout) or affiliate commission tracking that ISN'T a marketplace payout (use /sales-affiliate-program).
