Use when setting up AdGlare to serve display or video ads on your website, campaigns aren't delivering impressions or pacing is off, native ad zone JSON responses aren't rendering in your app, impression counts near your plan limit seem inaccurate, trying to automate ad ops with the AdGlare API but you're on Professional plan and can't access it, or comparing AdGlare to AdButler, Epom, or Google Ad Manager for a publisher ad server. Do NOT use for email newsletter ad serving (AdGlare has no email zones — use /sales-adbutler, /sales-adspeed, or /sales-revive), general newsletter monetization strategy (use /sales-newsletter), or programmatic RTB exchange setup (use /sales-epom)."

# AdGlare Platform Help

## Step 1 — Gather context

If `references/learnings.md` exists, read it first for accumulated platform knowledge.

1. **What are you trying to do?**
   - A) Set up AdGlare to serve display ads on my website
   - B) Serve native ads via JSON endpoint
   - C) Set up VAST video or CTV ad serving
   - D) Automate campaign management via the API
   - E) Compare AdGlare to other ad servers

2. **Your role?**
   - A) Publisher (monetizing my own site/app)
   - B) Advertiser (placing ads on publisher sites)
   - C) Ad agency (managing multiple clients)

3. **Current plan**: Lite (€99/mo), Professional (€499/mo), or Enterprise (€649/mo)?

Skip-ahead rule: if the user's prompt already contains enough context, skip to Step 2.

## Step 2 — Route or answer directly

| If the question is about... | Route to... |
|---|---|
| Email newsletter ad serving | AdGlare has NO email zones. Use `/sales-adbutler`, `/sales-adspeed`, or `/sales-revive` |
| Newsletter monetization strategy | `/sales-newsletter [question]` |
| Programmatic RTB exchange | `/sales-epom [question]` |
| Self-hosted free ad server | `/sales-revive [question]` |
| API-first custom ad platform | `/sales-kevel [question]` |

If the question is AdGlare-specific, continue to Step 3.

## Step 3 — AdGlare platform reference

**Read `references/platform-guide.md`** for the full platform reference — capabilities, pricing, zone types, API overview, integration recipes, code examples.

Answer the user's question using only the relevant section. Don't dump the full reference.

## Step 4 — Actionable guidance

Focus on the user's specific situation:

- **Publisher getting started**: Create a workspace, set up zones (display/native/VAST/redirect/catalog), create campaigns with targeting rules, link creatives to campaigns, get the ad tag or JSON endpoint, paste into your site template.
- **Native ads**: Create a native zone, fetch JSON from the zone endpoint, render with your own HTML template. Response includes title, description, image, CTA fields.
- **Video ads**: Create a VAST zone, get the VAST tag URL, configure your video player (JW Player, Video.js, etc.) to use it as a pre/mid/post-roll source.
- **API automation**: Enterprise plan required (€649/mo). Bearer token auth, base URL `https://{name}.api.adglare.app/v2`. Full CRUD on workspaces, campaigns, zones, creatives.
- **Choosing AdGlare vs alternatives**: AdGlare is best for publishers needing a premium hosted ad server with display, native, and video support, cookieless by design. For email newsletter ads, use AdButler or AdSpeed. For self-hosted free, use Revive. For API-first custom builds, use Kevel.

If you discover a gotcha, workaround, or tip not covered in `references/learnings.md`, append it there.

## Gotchas

> *Best-effort from research — review these, especially items about plan-gated features that may be outdated.*

1. **No email newsletter zones** — AdGlare supports display, native, VAST, redirect, and catalog zones only. If you need email ad serving, use AdButler, AdSpeed, Broadstreet, or Revive Adserver instead.
2. **API is Enterprise-only (€649/mo)** — the REST API v2 is not available on Lite (€99) or Professional (€499) plans. If you need API access on a budget, consider AdSpeed (API on all plans) or Epom (API from $250/mo).
3. **Native ads are Enterprise-only** — native ad format zones require the Enterprise plan.
4. **Impression tracking near plan limits** — users report inaccurate counting when approaching monthly impression caps. Monitor usage proactively and consider a buffer.
5. **Limited DSP/exchange integrations** — AdGlare has fewer native programmatic connections than platforms like OpenX or PubMatic. You may need custom integration work for programmatic demand.

## Examples

### Example 1: Setting up display ads on a publisher website
**User says**: "I just signed up for AdGlare Lite. How do I get display ads showing on my site?"
**Skill does**: Walks through creating a workspace, setting up a display zone with dimensions, creating a campaign with targeting and flight dates, uploading image/HTML5 creatives, linking the campaign to the zone, and getting the async JavaScript ad tag to paste into the site template
**Result**: User has display ads serving on their website with proper tracking

### Example 2: Automating campaign management via the API
**User says**: "How do I use the AdGlare API to create campaigns and pull reporting data?"
**Skill does**: Explains Enterprise plan requirement (€649/mo), demonstrates Bearer token auth, shows campaign creation with POST /campaigns endpoint including targeting/pacing fields, explains that Reports endpoint exists but docs were partially available, provides working cURL and Python examples
**Result**: User understands API access requirements and has working integration code

### Example 3: Choosing between ad servers
**User says**: "I publish a niche blog with 500K monthly pageviews and a weekly newsletter. Should I use AdGlare or AdButler?"
**Skill does**: Compares both: AdGlare (€99/mo Lite for 1M impressions, no email zones, cookieless, 220+ CDN nodes, API only on Enterprise) vs AdButler ($179/mo, email ad zones, self-serve portal, MCP server, REST API on all plans). Notes that AdGlare lacks email/newsletter zones, so for the newsletter component, AdButler or AdSpeed is needed.
**Result**: User picks the right ad server for their specific needs (web + newsletter)

## Troubleshooting

### Ads not delivering impressions
**Symptom**: Campaign is active but zone shows zero impressions
**Cause**: Campaign not linked to the correct zone, flight dates haven't started, or targeting rules are too restrictive
**Solution**: Verify the campaign is linked to an active zone, check that flight dates include today, review targeting rules (geo, time, frequency) to ensure they match your audience. Check the real-time reporting dashboard for serving errors.

### Native JSON endpoint returning empty
**Symptom**: Fetching the native zone URL returns no ad data
**Cause**: No active campaign with native creatives linked to the zone, or you're on a plan below Enterprise
**Solution**: Native ads require the Enterprise plan (€649/mo). Verify you have a campaign with native creatives (title, description, image, CTA) linked to the native zone. Test the zone URL directly in a browser to see the raw JSON response.

### Can't access the API
**Symptom**: API requests return authentication errors or 403
**Cause**: Your plan doesn't include API access — it's Enterprise-only (€649/mo)
**Solution**: Upgrade to the Enterprise plan. If budget is a constraint, consider AdSpeed (API on all plans from $9.95/mo), Epom (API from $250/mo), or Revive Adserver (free, self-hosted, XML-RPC API).
